# azul
So one day I got azul board game ([bgg link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul)).

Azul is a simple and yet beautiful game, one of those that are easy to learn and difficult to master.


So I got interested and wanted to create a script that can play azul. Also wanted tdd practice)

So here it is - just a script that can play azul board game :)

For now, it is a console version only, I had plans to add a browser one too, but had no time.

Run it with
```
php azul play
```
Looks like this:
